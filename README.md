# NYC Students during COVID
Every year, OpenNYC and related NYC-based organizations release reports on education outcomes for students in the NYC public school system. These rich datasets usually include various demographic data, as well as geographic location which can then be subsequently used to determine socio-economic status.

Oftentimes it is hard to pinpoint one singular key-event which has had an impact on student performance. In fact, when it comes to evaluating the pedagogical-practices of teachers and the structure of the classroom, we note that not much changes on a year-by-year basis. 

However the pandemic and subsequent closure of schools is one of those rare ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ moments that truly divided student performance. In fact, this drop in academic performance has been reported as being the “single largest drop in math in 50 years” (Washington Post, 2023). 

As such, the availability of these rich data sets represents a valuable data-monitoring opportunity in order to assess if we are “back on track”, or continuing the plunge in the NYC public school system.

# Goal
Analyze an NYC dataset of student data to analyze student performance. Some analytical questions/goals you may want to consider include:
- How has test performance changed after Covid? Does this vary across demographics?
- How has student attendance changed after Covid?
- How can we design a comprehensive data dashboard which provides up-to-date information on NYC student performance.
