# NYC Students during COVID
Goal: Analyze an NYC dataset of student data to analyze student performance. Some analytical questions/goals you may want to consider include:
- How has test performance changed after Covid? Does this vary across demographics?
- How has student attendance changed after Covid?
- How can we design a comprehensive data dashboard which provides up-to-date information on NYC student performance.
