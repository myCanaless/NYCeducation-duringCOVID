New York City Department of Education
"Report on Students in Temporary Housing, 2021"
Local Law No. 73
Notes 
"Students in temporary housing (STH) are defined as students experiencing housing instability at any point, for any length of time, during the school year (from the first day of school to 7/2). This includes students and families that are ""doubled up"" (sharing the housing of others due to economic hardship), living in shelter (including NYC Department of Homeless Services family shelters or Human Resources Administration domestic violence shelters), or living in some other unstable, temporary housing. There were approximately 87,000 New York City district school students who resided in temporary housing in the 2020-21 school year, with about two thirds of them residing in doubled up living arrangements. Approximately 9,500 of those 87,000 students were residing in the DHS shelter system on any given night. The DOE works in close partnership with the Department of Homeless Services to provide streamlined support for students in shelter throughout each day."
Data exclude students in charter schools. The overall number and percent of charter school STH are reported on the Citywide tab.
"In 2020-21, there were 87,170 students residing in temporary housing at any point throughout the school year, regardless of type of temporary housing or length of time. 17,171 of these students resided in a shelter operated by the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) at any point throughout the year."
"The total numbers of students and STH are disaggregated by school, based on the last school or program a student attended. "
"Total student enrollment numbers differ from the official 2020-21 enrollment counts, which are based on the October 31st Audited Register and can be found in the Demographic Snapshot on the NYC DOE website."
"Any student who resided in a DHS shelter at any point, for any amount of time, during the 2020-21 school year is counted as residing in a DHS shelter, regardless of whether they also resided in a shelter run by a different Department during the same school year."
The NYC DOE currently has a data-sharing agreement with DHS and is working towards additional data-sharing agreements with other City agencies operating shelters. The NYC DOE anticipates reporting disaggregations for students living in non-DHS shelters in future versions of this report.
"The Federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act requires school districts to ask families to report on their housing situation. Schools are only required to provide the housing questionnaire when they are aware that there is a change in address or if a family self-reports changes, so there may be instances where schools have outdated information."
Students are counted as remaining enrolled in a school in their borough of origin if they a) did not transfer during the 2020-21 school year or b) transferred during the school year to a school or schools in the same borough as the school they attended prior to the transfer.
"Students may be included in more than one form of transportation. All STH not receiving busing are eligible to receive MetroCards. For the purpose of this report, students are included in the MetroCard count if they were not assigned busing throughout the entire year.

Student transportation data was reported from October 2020 to June 2021 to account for the removal of remote students from transportation data that occurred in the end of September 2020. Due to the option to enroll in remote learning for the 2020-21 school year, fewer students were reported as provided busing in 2020-21. Additionally, starting in the 2020-21 school year, DOE and DSS/DHS began asking families to indicate their preference for busing or MetroCard, instead of automatically routing every student. This also resulted in a decrease of ridership."
"Attendance reporting excludes students in District 79, Young Adult Borough Centers (YABCs), District Pre-K Centers, home schooling, and NYC Early Education Centers (NYCEECs). The 2020-21 school year was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic."
"For this report, retention is defined as any student who was in temporary housing in 2019-20 and remained in the same grade level in 2020-21. Given the complexities of high school grade attribution, the retention rate is limited to students in Kindergarten through Grade 8."
"Due to the timing of this report, the STH dropout rate is calculated for the 4-year cohort that entered 9th grade in 2016-17 (Class of 2020). Graduation and dropout data for the 9th grade cohort that entered in 2017-18 (Class of 2021) will not be available until winter 2021."
The denominator for the 4-year dropout rate includes any student residing in temporary housing at any point throughout their four years in high school.
"Local Law 59, reporting on demographic data in NYC public schools, includes data on students in temporary housing, also disaggregated at the school-level. Local Laws 59 and 73 use different enrollment criteria and thus report different STH numbers. While this report includes all students enrolled and residing in temporary housing at any point throughout the year, Local Law 59 mirrors the NYC DOE's Demographic Snapshot, limiting data to students enrolled on 10/31."
